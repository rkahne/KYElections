Analyzing Kentucky's gubernatorial elections

Working to develop a data-driven analysis of past KY elections to better understand the path by which someone with my policy preferences could be elected Governor.

Worthwhile assets in this repo:
1. KY Gubernatorial Results back to 2015.
2. KY Presidential Results back to 2000.
3. Static Web Page describing correlation between % of Bevin vote to % Medicaid Increase.
